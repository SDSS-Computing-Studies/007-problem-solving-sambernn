## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #007 Creating a Click Bot

Objectives:
* Solve a complex problem through planning using code structures
* Make use of prebuilt modules not native to the Python basic installation
* Have programs receive automatic inputs.

Automation is becoming a huge deal, with robots replacing people doing
menial tasks every day.  Robots can be quite sophisticated, and are often
able to mimic the roles that humans once filled.

Today, we will be exploring the creation of a robot to play a simple game.
The simplest games are clicker games, although some of these can become
quite complicated.  In fact, a program can not only beat these games, but
solve more open ended games that might not appear to be simple on the surface.

To create a robot to play the game, you really need to understand the sequences
required to play the game.  There may be multiple screens; how do you navigate
between them?  There may be times that your bot becomes out of sync. How do you
detect problems and then have them fix themselves automatically?  These are
questions that we will need to address when we create our robots.

We will also be making use of 2 built in modules and 1 installed module
random
time
pyautogui

Pay close attention to today's example files, as they will be very important
in understanding how the code structures work.

##### Task 1: Become familiar with the time module
Open the file example1.py


##### Task 2: Become familiar with commands in the pyautogui module.
Visit: https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
Follow the instructions on installing pyautogui on your computer.
You may need to add an additional installation parameter: --user



##### Task 3: Planning sequences of Events
Write down the sequence of events or actions that you will need to program
into your game.  You may want to check pauses if your game needs to wait
for actions to complete. You will be submitting this document as part of
your assessment.
